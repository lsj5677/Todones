# Todones üìù

Todones means literally Todo + Agnes.
I built this website used by React.js
You can select the darkmode and create, read, update, and also delete Todos.

I used the localStorage, so it remembers the data you saved and the darkmode.
There are three categories (All/Active/Completed), so you can check each status.

You can see [Todones](https://todoagnes.netlify.app/).

## # Darkmode

I used variables of CSS, so if you select `Darkmode`, it will be add `dark` class on higher element.

## # Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in your browser.
